                                    	<p>The MOVE system was launched in February 2010, following a five year research effort. The system has increased the credibility and measurability of Outdoor advertising, and helped fuel the strong growth in the Outdoor advertising sector. In 2010, the Outdoor industry increased its revenue by 19%, or $77 million, and increased its share of all advertising from 3.18% to 3.54%. In 2011, Outdoor has continued to grow strongly, with quarter three year-on-year growth of 4.1%.</p>
                                   		<p>In 1996 the company was engaged by AOAMS Pty Ltd (a company owned by 20 media owners) to develop an Outdoor Audience Measurement System for Australia using these models.  The measurement system (ROAM – Research of Outdoor Audience Measurement) was progressively rolled out across Australia, but only covered roadside billboards and the in-vehicle viewing audience passing each billboard.</p>
                                    	<p>In November 2006, VLC (in collaboration with Cuende Infometrics, TNS and Access Testing) was awarded a contract to further develop the ROAM system to include a far wider range of formats (bus stops and street furniture, on bus, within airport, within train station and within shopping centre) and a wider viewing audience including public transport users and pedestrians.  The new system (MOVE) is due for launch in May 2008.  MOVE audience ratings will include VAC adjustment based on comprehensive, in-field, eye-tracking research currently being undertaken in Australia by VLC and Access Testing.</p>
                                    	<p>VLC is also in partnership with Goudappel Coffeng (the largest transport planning and travel modeling company in the Netherlands) for the development and world-wide marketing of the OmniTRANS travel forecasting software.  This software is by far the mostly widely used travel modeling software in the Netherlands.  As a consequence the View Consortium includes the company that has pioneered the application of comprehensive travel modelling techniques for outdoor audience measurement (VLC), and the most skilled and experienced travel modelers in the Netherlands (GC).</p>
